	<p class="heading-intro">Early access for market makers and liquidity providers.</p>

	<p>We've launched our Markets and Liquidity Programme to give liquidity providers exclusive access to the protocol ahead of the mainnet launch. This is an opportunity to evaluate Vega Protocol commercially and technically, as well as collaborate with stakeholders to ensure a mainnet launch that meets the needs of traders, market makers, and other participants in the system. More information on the programme can be found on our  <a href="https://community.vega.xyz/t/announcing-launch-of-our-markets-and-liquidity-programme/202" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
