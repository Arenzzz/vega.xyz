	<p class="heading-intro">API documentation coming soon.</p>
	<p>While we're in the early stages of our testnet, the APIs are changing so significantly that we haven't yet publicly published our API documentation. You will be able to integrate with the public Vega network through GRPC, REST, and GraphQL.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Early access for market makers and liquidity providers.</p>
	<p>We've launched our Markets and Liquidity Programme to give liquidity providers exclusive access to the protocol ahead of the public testnet launch. This is an opportunity to evaluate Vega Protocol commercially and technically, as well as collaborate with stakeholders to ensure a mainnet launch that meets the needs of traders, market makers, and other participants in the system. More information on the programme can be found on our <a href="https://community.vega.xyz/t/announcing-launch-of-our-markets-and-liquidity-programme/202" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
