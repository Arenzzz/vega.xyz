	<p class="heading-intro">We're running an invite-only test network.</p>

	<p>Though you can't interact with the testnet just yet, you can sign up to the <a href="#newsletter">newsletter</a> to find out when we'll be inviting people to use it, and sharing general updates.</p>

	<p>You can also <a href="https://community.vega.xyz" target="_blank">join our community forum</a> to pose questions to the team, find out what we've been up to, and share your own ideas of what the future of finance looks like.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">API documentation coming in early 2020.</p>
	<p>While we're in the beginning stages of our testnet, the APIs are changing so significantly that we haven't yet publicly published our API documentation. You will be able to integrate with the public Vega network through GRPC, REST, and GraphQL.</p>
