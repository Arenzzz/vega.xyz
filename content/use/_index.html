	<p class="heading-intro">Running a node on the Vega Testnet</p>

	<p>In the current phase, the Vega development team are running all nodes in the Vega Testnet. This allows the team to rapidly deploy new versions and maintain a fast pace of development. Alongside the next release of the Vega core software, codenamed Flamenco Tavern, we’ll be allowing some validators to run nodes. Following that, we’ll also provide downloads for non-validator users to run their own local nodes. Stay in touch through our <a href="https://community.vega.xyz" target="_blank">forums</a>, <a href="https://vega.xyz/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vegaprotocol" target="_blank">social media</a> for information and updates on these programmes.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Early access for market makers and liquidity providers.</p>

	<p>We've launched our Markets and Liquidity Programme to give liquidity providers exclusive access to the protocol ahead of the mainnet launch. This is an opportunity to evaluate Vega Protocol commercially and technically, as well as collaborate with stakeholders to ensure a mainnet launch that meets the needs of traders, market makers, and other participants in the system. More information on the programme can be found on our  <a href="https://community.vega.xyz/t/announcing-launch-of-our-markets-and-liquidity-programme/202" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
