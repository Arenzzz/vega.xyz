	<p class="heading-intro">API documentation coming soon.</p>
	<p>While we're in the early stages of our testnet, the APIs are changing so significantly that we haven't yet publicly published our API documentation. You will be able to integrate with the public Vega network through GRPC, REST, and GraphQL.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Early access for market makers and liquidity providers.</p>
	<p>We have launched an early access programme for market makers and liquidity providers to get on-boarding to the protocol, understand how to realise the unique revenue possibilities for providing liquidity on Vega, and work with us to refine the incentive mechanisms to ensure they are attractive to market makers both at launch and in the long term. More information can be found on our forum, or email <a href="tamlynr@vega.xyz">tamlynr@vega.xyz</a> to express your interest.</p>
