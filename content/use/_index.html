	<p class="heading-intro">Restricted mainnet is live</p>

	<p>Vega’s <a target="_blank" href="https://token.vega.xyz">Restricted Mainnet</a> is live. Delegate stake to validators, earn rewards by securing the network and get started with voting on governance proposals.</p>

	<p>Restricted Mainnet is positioned as an extended test phase, it is limited in functionality. It is the first of a three-stage launch process, it will be followed by Alpha Mainnet (trading with limits) and v1 Mainnet (unrestricted trading).</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Staking and Governance</p>

	<p>Vega Token holders can delegate tokens to validators on Restricted Mainnet and can therefore earn staking rewards for securing the network.</p>

	<p>Additionally, governance voting gives the Vega community a way to define the optimal network configuration in preparation for the Alpha Mainnet stage.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Running a node on the Vega Testnet</p>

	<p>In the current phase, a set of community based validators are operating a Vega Mainnet. These validators were selected using a governance vote with full details available on the <a href="https://blog.vega.xyz/mainnet-validator-recommendations-and-governance-vote-4b5573630321" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
	
	<p>In the future, it is likely that the team will provide downloads for non-validator users to run their own local nodes.</p>

	<p class="heading-intro">Early access for market makers and liquidity providers.</p>

	<p>We've launched our Markets and Liquidity Programme to give liquidity providers exclusive access to the protocol ahead of the mainnet launch. This is an opportunity to evaluate Vega Protocol commercially and technically, as well as collaborate with stakeholders to ensure a mainnet launch that meets the needs of traders, market makers, and other participants in the system. More information on the programme can be found on our  <a href="https://community.vega.xyz/t/announcing-launch-of-our-markets-and-liquidity-programme/202" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
