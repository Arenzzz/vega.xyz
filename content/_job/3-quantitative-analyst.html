You can try it out at <a target="_blank" href="https://testnet.vega.trading">https://testnet.vega.trading</a>.</p>
	<p>Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management.  We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.</p>
