			<p>We are building a blockchain-based derivatives exchange and are looking for a skilled golang engineer to to grow with us and make key contributions to the codebase. This is a great opportunity to join a small, VC-funded start-up with an office in Londonâ€™s fintech hub. We have a working prototype and have delivered the first version of the alpha to a small group of early users.</p>

			<p>We are designing the future for derivatives trading and our software will be a critical system for large financial institutions. With potentially trillions of dollars flowing through the system, quality and correctness need to be built in from day one.</p>

	<p>You are an experienced Go engineer who is interested in solving problems related to the intersection of financial trading, blockchain, and distributed systems. Being a startup, there will be times when the team needs to strive for absolute code quality for production releases, and others when we need to quickly pull together barely-working prototype code to test out an idea. We are looking for someone who can work in both modes as appropriate. </p>
