			<p>We are building a blockchain-based derivatives exchange and are looking for a skilled software test engineer to help keep a focus on quality. This is a great opportunity to join a small, VC-funded start-up with an office in London’s fintech hub. We have a working prototype and are well on our way to delivering the first version of the alpha.</p>

			<p>We are designing the future for derivatives trading and our software will be a critical system for large financial institutions. With potentially trillions of dollars flowing through the system, quality and correctness need to be built in from day one.</p>

	<h2 class="heading-panel" id="about-you">About you</h2>
	<p>You're a software engineer with a focus on ensuring your platform is robust, reliable and correct. You can imagine edge cases and implement tests to demonstrate the issue, and in many cases fix them. You can read a software specification and identify when code deviates from it, or if revisions are required to the specification you can take it upon yourself to propose the changes. Spinning up a temporary test network to simulate a 6 month old blockchain to identify a performance issue sounds like an adventure, not a problem. You use code to automate wherever possible. You’re scientifically minded with a high aptitude for problem solving, you have impeccable organisational skills and strong attention to detail. Traffic mirroring and backtesting are some of the approaches you'll bring with you.</p>
