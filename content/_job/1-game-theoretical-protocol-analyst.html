	<h2 class="heading-panel" id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>
	<p>Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at <a target="_blank" href="https://testnet.vega.trading">https://testnet.vega.trading</a>.</p>
	<p>Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management.  We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.</p>

	<p>You will work in the Research team working on protocol validation and testing as well as new product and protocol development. You will work closely with the engineering team who are implementing the core protocol. Your main task will be to develop end-to-end understanding of the protocol and tools (whether theoretical or code / agent based) for game theoretic analysis of the economic incentives of the protocol.</p>
