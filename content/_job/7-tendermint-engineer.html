	<h2 class="heading-panel" id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>
	<p>Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at <a target="_blank" href="https://testnet.vega.trading">https://testnet.vega.trading</a>.</p>
	<p>Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management.  We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.</p>

This includes pre-processing transactions for fairness (see <a target="_blank" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/885">https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/885</a>) and spam protection, as well as potential modifications to the gossiping protocol, key management, sharding support or use of more elaborate validator weight systems. Where possible, you will also work with research on protocol design and optimizations. For this, we need a tendermint engineer with
