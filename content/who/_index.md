Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace.

The power of community is central to what we're creating, and that starts with our team. We are a collaborative team of 18 who are interested in learning from each other and tackling complex challenges together. We are distributed across the world, and are open to flexible working hours. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management.

We're looking for people who believe in the power of decentralisation and are interested in solving complex problems.
