## About you

You are a Quantitative Analyst with experience in cross asset derivatives and their risk management or algorithmic trading or a recent graduate with necessary technical background and willingness to learn on the job and grow with the role. You can analyse and understand complex systems and choose the right tools to model their behaviour and reason about them.

## About the project

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at [https://testnet.vega.trading](https://testnet.vega.trading).

Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management. We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.
