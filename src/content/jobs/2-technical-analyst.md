We are building a blockchain-based fully automated and open derivatives exchange and are looking for a Technical Analyst.

**Start date:**  
Immediate

Remote (between UTC-8 and UTC+1) or London or Edinburgh

## About you

You have the training and ideally the experience to understand and reason about complex systems. You know how to gather requirements, turn them into well written technical specification documents and provide test scenarios to verify the specification is implemented correctly. Role is open to graduates.

## About the project

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at [https://testnet.vega.trading](https://testnet.vega.trading).

Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management. We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.

## About the role

You will work with the Product and Research teams on new product and protocol development. You will work closely with the engineering team who are implementing the core protocol. Your main task will be analysing and collecting requirements, writing technical specifications and providing test scenarios that can verify that the specifications are correctly implemented.
