We are building a blockchain-based fully automated and open derivatives exchange and are looking for an experienced Game Theoretical Protocol Analyst.

**Start date:**  
Immediate

**Location:**  
Remote (between UTC-8 and UTC+1) or London or Edinburgh

**Type:**  
Permanent or long-term contract

## About you

You are highly numerate with experience of analysing and modelling complex systems. You breathe game theory and dream about agent based models.

## About the project

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at https://testnet.vega.trading.

Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management. We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.

## About the role

You will work in the Research team working on protocol validation and testing as well as new product and protocol development. You will work closely with the engineering team who are implementing the core protocol. Your main task will be to develop end-to-end understanding of the protocol and tools (whether theoretical or code / agent based) for game theoretic analysis of the economic incentives of the protocol.

## Relevant qualities or experience

**Required**

- Degree in a numerate discipline (Maths, Physics, Computer Science or Economics)
- Deep knowledge of game theory and agent based modelling
- Knowledge of various blockchain and DeFi protocols
- Strong programming skills
- Collaborative and able and willing to work in a remote-first environment

**Desirable, but not essential**

- Working knowledge of Go and Python
- PhD on a relevant topic
- You have audited DeFi protocols before
- Experience in science communication
- Prior experience working remotely
