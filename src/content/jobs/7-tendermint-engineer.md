We are building a blockchain-based fully automated and open derivatives exchange and are looking for a Tendermint Engineer.

**Start date:**  
Immediate

**Location:**  
Remote (between UTC-8 and UTC+1) or London or Edinburgh

**Type:**  
Permanent or long-term contract

## About you

You are highly experienced with the Tendermint blockchain protocol and implementation; You live in the Tendermint mempool and organise parties there. If you run private nodes they are always 3x more efficient than all the others.

## About the project

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial products. We believe that markets should be open and participants should benefit from a well functioning marketplace. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at [https://testnet.vega.trading](https://testnet.vega.trading).

Our team of 30 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management. We operate distributed, cross-functional teams.

## About the role

To optimize the Vega performance and security, we plan for some alterations and additions to the Tendermint implementation. This includes pre-processing transactions for fairness (see [https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/885](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/885)) and spam protection, as well as potential modifications to the gossiping protocol, key management, sharding support or use of more elaborate validator weight systems. Where possible, you will also work with research on protocol design and optimizations. For this, we need a tendermint engineer with:

**Relevant qualities**

- Experience with the Tendermint implementation, especially mempool management
- Strong programming skills
- Collaborative and able and willing to work in a remote-first environment

**Desirable**

- Ideally, some experience with implementing cryptographic primitives
- Some understanding of Byzantine distributed protocol design
- Knowledge of other blockchain implementations
- Having worked with a validator running tendermint
