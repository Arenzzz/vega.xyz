---

We are building a blockchain-based derivatives exchange and are looking for a skilled Front-End engineer / developer to join the Console team at Vega. The primary goal is to build the ‘reference’ interface - a fully featured, web-based client for Vega Protocol. This is a large project, covering trading, platform governance and interacting with Vega’s own blockchain, smart contracts and third party chains.

In this role you will mainly work with the Console team building out the first fully-featured Vega trading interface. This is a large codebase that has been built with TypeScript, React and Apollo Client. While the Console is currently closed source, the code will move to be fully open source in the near future, along with the rest of our codebase.

**Start date:**  
Immediate

**Location:**  
London or remote

**Type:**  
Permanent or contract

## About you

You are a developer with experience on working on large, application-like web interfaces. You’ve either worked with React long enough, or worked with other frameworks enough to have a natural feel for where state should live and when it’s time to reach for some more complex state management. While this is a front-end role that leans heavily on TypeScript & JavaScript targeting the browser, you’ll probably have delved into node and deployed server side code.

## About Vega

It is Vega’s mission to build tools for decentralised trading that allow anyone on earth to trade freely, with open and fully access to their trading and risk data and no artificial barriers to entry or reliance on centralised entities. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at [https://console.fairground.wtf/](https://console.fairground.wtf/)

Our team of 40 is interested in learning from each other and solving complex challenges, with a vibe that can be described as ‘relaxed excellence’. Our professional backgrounds include trading and markets infrastructure, development, academia, and business management
