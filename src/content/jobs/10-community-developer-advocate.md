We're looking for a Community Developer Advocate to work with Vega’s up and coming community of builders and to help people understand our technology.

Are you from a coding/development background but interested in talking about DeFi and all things Crypto, then why not come and join the Vega team?

**Start date:**  
Immediate

**Location:**  
Remote (between UTC-8 and UTC+1)

**Type:**  
Permanent or long-term contract

**A little bit more about Vega just in case you didn’t know...**

It is Vega's mission to build tools for decentralised trading that allow anyone on earth to trade freely, with open and full access to their trading and risk data and no artificial barriers to entry or reliance on centralised entities. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet was opened to the public in late 2020. The Vega Mainnet is due to go live in Q4 2021. You can try the Fairground Testnet out at https://console.fairground.wtf/.

Our short-term target is ambitious but achievable: to create a fully decentralised, open-source trading platform.

**Start date:**  
Immediate

**Location:**  
Remote (between UTC-8 and UTC+1)

**Type:**  
Permanent or long-term contract

## The Role

Work directly with our growing community of developers as they build on our platform; speaking at events (if you’re keen to do so); producing code content; creating documentation or user guides to help our community learn how to build on Vega.

- Collaborate closely with other Developer advocates and Vega teams to champion for the community internally during planning and feature delivery.
- Assist in the full lifecycle of designing, launching and running community incentives, see the [ERC20 deposit and withdrawal](https://fairground.wtf/erc20bridge) challenge for an example.
- Participate actively in discussions on social media via the Vega Discord, Telegram and Twitter channels. Assist with moderation where required.
- Be a full time participant in the [Vega Builders Club](https://blog.vega.xyz/introducing-the-vega-builders-club-c401595699c6), worldwide hackathons and workshops. International travel where possible for in-person events.
- Build and maintain open-source web tools to support the growth and development of Vega in the community

## You will have the opportunity to

Become a specialist on the technical features and capabilities of Vega.

- Be seen as an influential speaker in the Vega and wider DeFi community.
- Be creative in implementing your approach to delivering content to developers and continuously work on unique ways to engage with the community

## Desirable Requirements

Ideally, you have 2-3+ years of experience developing code in a commercial environment and/or demonstrable experience contributing to open-source projects.

- Familiarity with languages such as Node.js, TypeScript, Python, Golang or Java.
- Solid understanding of API design principles and exposure to front-end development; we write simple and useful tools to support community growth.
- Prior experience with developer relations, developer advocacy or developer evangelism is preferred but not essential to apply.
- You have exceptional written English communication to a native/fluent level.
- You’re able to work in a fast-paced environment - Vega’s needs change as we reach
  different stages of development (your job might look different in a few months' time, but we’ll support you every step of the way).
- You’re a good communicator with writing skills that allow you to convey information in a creative and engaging manner when required.
- You are eager to learn the intricacies of Vega, what it means to be a layer-1 DeFi derivatives protocol, and continue to build your knowledge of a complex project to help engage and support our community.

## About you

Being a startup, there will be times when the team needs to strive for absolute code quality for production releases, and others when we need to quickly pull together barely-working prototype code to test out an idea. We are looking for someone who can work in both modes as appropriate.

**And one more thing...**

In return for working on the Vega project, you get a competitive salary, the ability to work at the cutting edge of new technology, remotely, on your own schedule (with the option to get a local co-working space).
