**Type:**  
Permanent or long-term contract

We are looking for someone, ideally who is already part of the Vega community, who is great
with words and loves DeFi and all things Crypto, to come and join the Vega team to manage
our social media.

We’ve kept our social profile pretty low-key to date and think the project is now at a stage
where we can start to develop more of a presence on Twitter and other platforms and we
want you to lead the way.

You will work with the community, marketing, engineering and research teams to decide on
content and will have very strong creative control over how you deliver it.

If you have always wanted to be at the heart of a team building the Web3 future, and want to
be a big part of getting the Vega voice out into the world then this might be the role for you.

**A little bit more about Vega just in case you didn’t know**

It is Vega’s mission to build tools for decentralised trading that allow anyone on earth to
trade freely, with open and full access to their trading and risk data and no artificial barriers
to entry or reliance on centralised entities. The project began in early 2018, and our testnet
was opened to the public in late 2020. You can try it out at [https://console.fairground.wtf/](https://console.fairground.wtf/).

Our short-term target is ambitious but achievable: to create a fully decentralised,
open-source trading platform.

## The role

- To be responsible for growing the Vega presence on social media. Working with the
  team to understand the right content, you will look after the creative execution of all
  our social media.
- You will need to be a practitioner - so you will be writing and creating, and if you want
  to hire a team to help you, that is cool too.
- Competitive salary, we are very flexible on how you want to work / be paid so let’s
  discuss

## You will have the opportunity to:

- Be creative in implementing your approach to social media channels and continuously work on unique ways to engage with the community.
- Monitor owned channels for sentiment analysis and identify opportunities for Vega to
  contribute as a market participant, commentator, and conversation starter (owned channels - [https://linktr.ee/vegaprotocol](https://linktr.ee/vegaprotocol))
- Provide timely updates to the community including: events, content, engagement pieces, technical/business announcements.
- Provide timely feedback and report on strategy success/failures, with a view to continuously refine and improve output.
- With adequate communication with the rest of the team, monitor and respond to community members' queries.
- Evaluate new platforms to adopt as part of our overall communication strategy.

## Desirable Requirements:

You have worked in or been a very active member of a Crypto/Blockchain community - You love DeFi and have a PhD in Memetics (or you’re ngmi!)

- Ideally, you have 2+ years of experience with social media marketing (paid & unpaid) on Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Instagram (or similar)
- You’re able to work in a fast-paced environment - Vega’s needs change as we reach different stages of development (your job might look different in a few months time, but we’ll support you every step of the way)
- You’re a good communicator with fantastic writing skills that allow you to convey information in a creative and engaging manner when required
- You’re an active user of various social media platforms with the ability to have a voice and personality while engaging with the community
- You are eager to learn the intricacies of Vega, what it means to be a layer-1 DeFi derivatives protocol, and continue to build your knowledge of a complex project to help engage and support our community
- You have exceptional written English communication to a native/fluent level
- You are able to effectively manage your time between multiple channels and manage a range of suggestions, feedback, and support within community channels
- You are familiar with navigating around sensitive topics, as well as ensuring a balance between aiding the community and remaining in line with regulatory and legal requirements

In return for working with Vega, you get the ability to work at the cutting edge of new technology, remotely, on your own schedule (with the option to get a local co-working space).
