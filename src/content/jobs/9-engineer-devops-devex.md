Vegaâ€™s mission is to build tools that guarantee the freedom to trade and make that freedom accessible to
anyone on earth.

Vega is building a high-throughput, low-latency platform for decentralised margin trading of financial
products. The project began in early 2018; in 2020, we started Testnet, and in 2021 Mainnet.

Vega completed a token sale on CoinList this year in June, raising funds for the next several years. We
have just launched our Vega Mainnet in November, and we are super excited to add and enable more and more functionality. But there is still a lot to be implemented, and because of that, we need you to help us get Vega and the whole DeFi to the next level.

## The team

We are a remote first team working across Europe and North America. We are all passionate about
different things, like food, animals, travelling, football, e-sports, etc., but we all share a passion for decentralisation, openness, and fairness. Everyone at Vega brings experience in their respective fields: financial, research, engineering, blockchain. We have traders from London City, academic researchers, and people who were experts in distributed consensus way before Bitcoin existed.

## About the role

Blockchain technology forces engineers to think differently and seek revolutionary solutions every day.
We at Vega are creating cutting edge solutions in that world, like Wendy the fairness widget. We believe
that you will be able to join our team, share your ideas and together, we can shift the world toward
decentralisation.

Specifically, as an Automation and DevOps engineer, you will know how to configure and set up a new
Vega network from scratch. We trust that you will help us continue automating (CI/CD) all the aspects of
the development process to enable us to move 2-3x faster. You should be comfortable with joining
fast-paced, focused teams to prepare prototypes to test ideas quickly. At the same time, we want you to
have some spare time to focus on things you think are essential for Vega and the decentralised world to
succeed.

Some of the cool things we have done as DevOps includes multi-cloud (AWS+GCP) Vega networks,
trading bots (Go+grpc), automated network creation in under 2 min for every PR commit (docker), CI
autoscaling (Jenkins), and more.

Some of the upcoming projects in our backlog are: chaos monkey, block explorer, move automated
network creation to the next level, and more.
