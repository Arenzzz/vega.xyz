      "This is the first of 3 launch phases of the network in which the validators are running a decentralised Vega network connected to the Ethereum mainnet. This phase provides a proving ground for the proof of stake network, allows time for the community to learn how to reliably operate nodes, and introduces on-chain governance. Token holders can participate in governance, and stake and delegate their tokens.",

      "In this phase the validators will upgrade the decentralised Vega mainnet by deploying the MVP of the trading feature set. This will allow the creation of markets and trading for the first time in mainnet. As this is an early launch phase, the network is expected to be configured by the community to initially place fairly conservative temporary limits on the amount of funds that may be risked. Community early adopters and ecosystem members will be able to use this phase to try out their ideas for markets and test integrations with their own projects and protocols.",

    content:
      "Full Mainnet begins with successful completion of the launch phases. At this point the community and validators will have signalled their confidence in the software via on-chain governance votes and all remaining temporary limits will have been removed. During this phase, the development of the protocol and software will focus on enabling market innovation and iterating on feedback received from the community. This will include the addition of key features not present in the initial MVP, examples of which could include spot markets, passive liquidity, Ethereum oracles. New bridges to other blockchains and/or L2s will also be introduced during this phase.",

    content:
      "This release will allow the validators to launch an experimental mainnet using the second major release of the Vega protocol. The V2 protocol will use WASM to allow the community to create their own products & risk models, and control other aspects of the protocol. This version will also contain a number of performance and security improvements as well as core protocol upgrades and simplifications.",
